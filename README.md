## Installation

I havent requested this mod to be added to the Monke Mod Manager yet, so you'll have to install it manually for now:

- Download the [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager/releases/latest).
- Install BepInEx and Utilla using the Monke Mod Manager.
- [Download the latest release of the LIV mod](https://github.com/Raicuparta/GorillaTagLIV/releases/latest).
- Extract it to the Gorilla Tag folder (usuall something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag`).

## First start

The first time you run the game with the LIV mod installed, LIV won't detect is as having the LIV SDK enabled. So you'll have to run the game normally, use the "Manual" mode in LIV to select `Gorilla Tag.exe`.

## After first start

After you started the game with LIV once and everything was working, you can start the game directly from LIV. The game should now show in the game seleciton dropdown, in the "Auto" tab. If it does't show up under the "LIV enabled" section, retart LIV.
