Adds [LIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) support to Gorilla Tag (PCVR only, no Quest Support for now). With it, you can use mixed reality capture (video where you have your real body inserted into the game), avatars (custom 3D avatars with a dynamic camera that can be in third person, while you play the game normally in first person), smoothed first person view, and more.

## Usage

You need [LIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) installed and running to use this mod. Run LIV, and then run the capture tool:

You'll also have to configure LIV with either a real camera (for mixed reality) or a virtual camera (for 3D avatars). [Check the LIV documentation to learn how to set everything up](https://help.liv.tv/hc/en-us/categories/360002747940-LIV-Setup).

If the LIV capture tool was already running when you installed the Gorilla Tag LIV mod, restart it. Gorilla Tag should now show in the game selection dropdown, in the "Auto" tab:

Then you can press "Sync & Launch" in the same tab to start the game.

If you can't get this to work, try the "Manual" tab instead. Start Gorilla Tag via Steam, and select the Gorilla Tag exe (while the game is running):
